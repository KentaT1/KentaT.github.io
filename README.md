HAKO - SPACED REPETITION FLASHCARD APP
COMPLETE DESCRIPTION & LANDING PAGE CONTENT
================================================================================

APP DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

Hako is a modern, intelligent spaced repetition flashcard application designed 
to make learning more effective, engaging, and enjoyable. Built with cutting-edge 
technology and powered by proven learning algorithms, Hako transforms the way you 
study and retain information.

At its core, Hako uses the scientifically-proven SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) spaced 
repetition algorithm to optimize your study schedule. Cards you struggle with 
appear more frequently, while mastered content is reviewed at increasingly longer 
intervals, maximizing retention while minimizing study time.

What sets Hako apart is its innovative user experience. The app features a 
Tinder-style swipe interface that makes studying feel like a game, not a chore. 
Simply swipe right when you know the answer, left when you need more practice. 
The app handles all the scheduling automatically.

Hako also leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize flashcard creation. 
Instead of manually creating hundreds of cards, simply describe a topic and let 
AI generate a complete deck tailored to your needs. Whether you're studying 
Spanish vocabulary, World War 2 history, or organic chemistry, Hako's AI can 
create comprehensive, well-structured flashcards in seconds.

The app includes powerful organization features like folders, tags, and deck 
management, allowing you to structure your learning materials exactly how you 
want. Import existing decks from Anki, CSV, or text files, or start fresh with 
AI-generated content.

Visual learners will appreciate the contribution heatmap, inspired by GitHub's 
activity graph, which provides a beautiful visual representation of your study 
habits over time. Track your streaks, see your progress, and stay motivated with 
clear visual feedback.

Hako is available on iOS, Android, and Web, with seamless cloud sync ensuring 
your progress is always accessible across all your devices. Premium features 
unlock unlimited cards, advanced AI capabilities, automatic sync, and more.

Whether you're a student preparing for exams, a professional learning new skills, 
or a lifelong learner exploring new topics, Hako adapts to your learning style 
and helps you achieve your goals faster.
